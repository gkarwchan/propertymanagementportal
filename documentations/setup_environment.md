# Setup environment:

Setup environment has two stages:

1. setup your machine: Although you can automate everything from DevOps, but you for sure need to do manual check, or manual fixing for some issues, so better to prepare your machine.
2. Prepare Azure: DevOps CD will deploy to specific resource group, and give permission to DevOps to deploy to your Azure subscription. Although you can still automate this step from DevOps, but because this step run only once, so better to run it from your machine.
